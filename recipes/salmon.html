            <p>
                This is a quick, easy recipe with delicious results. 
                Honey-glazed salmon with a tasty lemon-butter sauce
                and a garlic kick. It pairs great with some asparagus
                and rice, or even better, a white wine. 
            </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 (6 oz) salmon filets</li>
                <li>2 tbsp flour</li>
                <li>4 tbsp honey</li>
                <li>4 tbsp butter</li>
                <li>2 tbsp lemon juice</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp garlic salt</li>
                <li>1 tsp pepper</li>
                <li>1 tbsp parsley</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Thaw salmon for 30-60 minutes in cold water.</li>
                <li>Marinate salmon in lemon juice for 10+ minutes in
                    refrigerator.</li>
                <li>Remove salmon and pat dry with paper towels.
                    Evenly coat both sides with flour, then drizzle 
                    approximately 1 tablespoon of honey on each side.</li>
                <li>Coat a large nonstick pan with cooking spray or 
                    olive oil. Place both pieces of salmon in pan and
                    cook over medium heat, 3-5 minutes per side. </li>
                <li>While salmon is cooking, prepare sauce. Place
                    butter in a small saucepan over low-medium heat,
                    swirling occasionally, until melted. Stir in
                    lemon juice, garlic salt, and pepper. Stir often
                    and continue to saute for 1 minute. Rewarm if
                    needed.</li>
                <li>When salmon is fully cooked, plate and cover each
                    fillet with sauce. Serve immediately.</li>
