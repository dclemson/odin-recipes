        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                This recipe is for a super yummy, cheesy take on a
                chicken enchilada stew. When I first tried to make
                this recipe, it was supposed to be a casserole, but
                that didn't work out too well. So we've settled on
                more of a soup, but that doesn't change how tasty
                it is! Grab your crockpot for this simple, yet 
                comforting meal.
